# TicTacToe-minimax

<h2>About</h2>
This Tic Tac Toe game is impossible to beat, why is that? Because the algorithm knows how to win or draw every, single, time.

This is achieved using [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) which minimizes a possible loss by mapping out every move the opponent can make, and scoring each outcome, which ever outcome returns with the highest score, the artificial intelligence will chose that move for their turn.

Test out the game here in the [demo](https://git.heroku.com/tictactoe-youcantwin.git)
