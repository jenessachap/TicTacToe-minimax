# TicTacToe-minimax

<h2>About</h2>
This Tic Tac Toe game is impossible to beat, why is that? Because the algorithm knows how to win or draw every, single, time.

This is achieved using [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) which minimizes a possible loss by mapping out every move the opponent can make, and scoring each outcome, which ever outcome returns with the highest score, the artificial intelligence will chose that move for their turn.

Test out the game here in the [demo](https://git.heroku.com/tictactoe-youcantwin.git)

<h2>Development</h2>
Fork and clone this repo, navigate to the directory in your terminal and run the following


`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm start` 

The game should now be seen at [http://localhost:3333/](http://localhost:3333/)


<h2>Some stretch features I would like to implement</h2>

- Change this game to Connect 4 with minimax

- Add other AI features to make the game feel more realistic (animations, timing, ai comments/banter)


Please suggest more features I can add or submit a PR if you create something!
